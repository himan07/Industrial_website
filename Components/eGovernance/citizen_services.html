          Citizen services are the services that a government provides to its
          citizens, such as healthcare, education, transportation, public
          safety, social welfare, and more. These services are designed to meet
          the basic needs of citizens and ensure their well-being. Our Citizen
          services software can be provided at different levels of government,
          including local, state/provincial, and national/federal levels.
