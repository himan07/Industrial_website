          A Correspondence (or a DAK) Management System is a system used by
          organizations to manage and track the flow of different types of
          correspondence within the organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          This system includes tools for creating and organizing digital
          documents, as well as software for tracking the status of documents as
          they move through various stages of review, approval, and
          distribution. DAK/File Management Systems also include features for
          automating workflows and setting up notifications or alerts for
          specific events or milestones.
