          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >Multi-class and Binary Classification: </span
            ><br />Our software is capable of performing both multi-class
            classification (assigning documents to multiple categories) and
            binary classification (assigning documents to two categories).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Customizable Taxonomies: </span
            ><br />It allows users to define and customize the taxonomy or set
            of categories relevant to their specific application or domain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >Natural Language Processing (NLP): </span
            ><br />Utilizes NLP techniques to process and analyze text data,
            including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Feature Extraction: </span><br />It
            extracts relevant features or attributes from text data, such as
            keywords, phrases, and word embeddings, to facilitate
            classification.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Machine Learning Algorithms: </span
            ><br />The software incorporates various machine learning
            algorithms, such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and deep
            learning models (e.g., neural networks), for classification tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Supervised Learning: </span
            ><br />Our Text Classification solution requires labeled training
            data for supervised learning, where documents are categorized based
