          XDR, or Extended Detection and Response, is a next-generation security
          technology that provides a more comprehensive approach to threat
          detection and response. CostaCloud's XDR solution is designed to
          consolidate and correlate data from multiple security products, such
          as endpoint protection platforms, network security systems, and cloud
          security services, into a single platform to provide a more complete
          view of security threats.
