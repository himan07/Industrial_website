        <p>
          Grievance management is the process of addressing and resolving
          complaints or grievances from employees, customers, or other
          stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an important part of human resources management and customer
          service, as it helps to ensure that issues are addressed promptly and
          effectively, and that stakeholders feel heard and respected.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an organizational context, grievances can take many forms, such as
          complaints about workplace policies, discrimination, harassment,
          safety concerns, or customer service issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          An effective grievance management software typically involves a clear
          and transparent process for reporting and investigating grievances, as
          well as mechanisms for resolving disputes and implementing corrective
          action where necessary.
